## Developing The Jellyfin Roku App
Follow the steps below to install the app on your personal Roku device for development.

### Developer Mode

Put your Roku device in [developer mode](https://blog.roku.com/developer/2016/02/04/developer-setup-guide). Write down your Roku device IP and the password you created, you will need these later.

### Clone the GitHub Repo

Navigate to where you'd like to install the app then copy the application files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-roku.git
```

Open up the new folder:

```bash
cd jellyfin-roku
```

Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```



## Method 1: Visual Studio Code
We recommend using Visual Studio Code when working on this project. The [BrightScript Language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RokuCommunity.brightscript) provides a rich debugging experience, including in-editor syntax checking, debugging/breakpoint support, variable inspection at runtime, auto-formatting, an integrated remote control mode, and [much more](https://rokucommunity.github.io/vscode-brightscript-language/features.html).

### Installation
1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the **BrightScript Language** extension within VSCode in the _Extensions_ panel or by downloading it from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RokuCommunity.brightscript).

### Usage
1. Open the `jellyfin-roku` folder in vscode
2. Press `F5` on your keyboard or click `Run` -> `Start Debugging` from the vscode menu. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/170696233-8ba49bf4-bebb-4655-88f3-ac45150dda02.png)

3. Enter your Roku IP address and developer password when prompted

That's it! vscode will auto-package the project, sideload it to the specified device, and the channel is up and running. (assuming you remembered to put your device in [developer mode](#developer-mode))


### Hardcoding Roku Information
Out of the box, the Brightscript extension will prompt you to pick a Roku device (from devices found on your local network) and enter a password on every launch. If you'd prefer to hardcode this information rather than entering it every time, you can set these values in your vscode user settings:

```js
{
    "brightscript.debug.host": "YOUR_ROKU_HOST_HERE",
    "brightscript.debug.password": "YOUR_ROKU_DEV_PASSWORD_HERE",
}
```

Example:

## Method 2: Sideload to Roku Device Manually

### Install Necessary Packages

```bash
sudo apt-get install wget make zip
```

### Build the package
```bash
make dev
```

This will create a zip in `out/apps/Jellyfin_Roku-dev.zip`. Login to your roku's device in your browser and upload the zip file then run install.

## Method 3: Direct load to Roku Device

### Login Details

Run this command - replacing the IP and password with your Roku device IP and dev password from the first step:

```bash
export ROKU_DEV_TARGET=192.168.1.234
export ROKU_DEV_PASSWORD=password
```

Normally you would have to open up your browser and upload a .zip file containing the app code. These commands enable the app to be zipped up and installed on the Roku automatically which is essential for developers and makes it easy to upgrade in the future for users.

### Install Necessary Packages

```bash
sudo apt-get install wget make zip
```

### Deploy

Package up the application, send it to your Roku, and launch the channel:

```bash
make install
```

Note: You only have to run this command once if you are not a developer. The Jellyfin channel will still be installed after rebooting your Roku device.

## Bug/Crash Reports

Did the app crash? Find a nasty bug? Use the this command to view the error log and [report it to the developers](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-roku/issues):

```bash
telnet ${ROKU_DEV_TARGET} 8085
```

To exit telnet: `CTRL + ]` and then type `quit + ENTER`

## Upgrade

Navigate to the folder where you installed the app then upgrade the code to the latest version:

```bash
git pull
```

Deploy the app:

```bash
make install
```

### Command Line Workflow

Modify code -> `make install` -> Use Roku remote to test changes -> `telnet ${ROKU_DEV_TARGET} 8085` -> `CTRL + ]` -> `quit + ENTER`

Unfortunately there is no debuger. You will need to use telnet to see log statements, warnings, and error reports. You won't always need to telnet into your device but the workflow above is typical when you are new to Brightscript or are working on tricky code.

Install necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
```

### Committing

Before commiting your code, please run:

```bash
make prep_commit
```

This will format your code and run the CI checks locally to ensure you will pass the CI tests.

### (Optional) Update Images

This repo already contains all necessary images for the app. This script only needs to be run when the [official Jellyfin images](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-ux) are changed to allow us to update the repo images.

Install necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

Download and convert images:

```bash
make get_images
```
