# Welcome

Use the `Modules` dropdown or the search feature to find functions and files to inspect

## Known Issues

- BrighterScript namespaces:
  - Duplicate function names will prevent the entire file from being parsed by JSDoc i.e. having `namespace.red.Delete()` and `namespace.blue.Delete()`
- The line numbers listed for functions are incorrect.
- The syntax highlighter treats all source files as JavaScript.
